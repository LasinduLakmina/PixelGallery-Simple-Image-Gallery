# PixelGallery--Simple-Image-Gallery

A retro-futuristic image gallery with a synthwave vibe. This gallery allows users to upload images that appear as floating cards with a neon glow effect. Each image can be clicked to expand with a holographic zoom effect and deleted with a "digital dissolve" animation. The design takes inspiration from the synthwave aesthetic, featuring vibrant neon colors and glitch effects.

## Features

- **Upload Images**: Upload images that are displayed as floating cards with a glowing neon border.
- **Holographic Zoom**: Click on an image to expand it with a futuristic zoom effect.
- **Digital Dissolve**: Delete an image with a stylish "digital dissolve" animation.
- **Futuristic Design**: Synthwave-inspired palette (pink, purple, teal) with a grid overlay.
- **Glitch Effects**: Add VHS-style scanlines and glitch effects using CSS filters.
- **3D Card Effects**: Use CSS transforms for interactive hover effects like card flips or tilts.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Structure of the image gallery and user interface.
